abstract:  _Premise of research_ Plants in natural and agricultural systems are influenced in myriad ways by their microbial communities, particularly by providing goods and services that change plant functional traits. Microbes are considered an influential part of the environmental context that change plant trait expression, but often, microbe-mediated effects are contingent on local resources, such as nitrogen. Here, we ask how microbes and nitrogen affect belowground functional traits and patterns of phenotypic selection. Methodology. We performed a fully factorial greenhouse experiment with switchgrass (*Panicum virgatum*), manipulating microbial community composition and nitrogen availability. We measured plant performance and belowground functional traits and performed 16S amplicon sequencing of the root-associated microbial communities. We looked for correlations between microbial taxa and root functional traits, and we performed phenotypic selection analysis on five belowground functional traits to determine how traits affect plant relative performance across biotic and abiotic contexts
