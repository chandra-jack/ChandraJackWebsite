## The evolution of cooperation is key to understanding the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular organisms and complex societies 


For my PhD, I studied the impact of cooperation and conflict on the fitness of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium in the Strassmann/Queller lab. Unlike metazoans that go through a single-cell bottleneck at the zygote stage, Dictyostelium forms a metazoan-like aggregate that may be made up of several genotypes, thus providing an arena for competition, conflict, and manipulation between clones of varying degrees of relatedness. My graduate research provided a greater understanding of how kin competition and microbial cooperation may have evolved and remained stable.

Take home points:
- By selectively aggregating with kin, Dictyostelium reduce conflict and increase their fitness (Mehdiabadi, <b> Jack </b> et al 2005). 

- Founder effects and genetic drift can passively increase and maintain relatedness without relying on a more active mechanism such as kin recognition (Buttery, <b>Jack</b> et al 2012)

- Clonal slugs travel further than heterogeneous slugs, indicating that intraspecific competition decreases overall group fitness. Migration alleviated conflicts of interest, leading to a decrease in facultative cheating in heterogeneous slugs I found that  (<b>Jack et al 2015</b>)

- Two of the most closely related species, <i>D. discoideum</i> and <i>D. purpureum</i>, may inadvertently find themselves in the same initial aggregate, but incompatibilities due to differences in the timing of cell specialization can cause almost total segregation during early slug formation (<b>Jack et al 2011</b> )

- Cells that remain in the mixed aggregates form heterospecific slugs that allow them to traverse greater distances over smaller conspecific slugs, which is advantageous, but are at a fitness disadvantage compared to conspecific slugs of the same size (<b>Jack et al 2008</b> ).
