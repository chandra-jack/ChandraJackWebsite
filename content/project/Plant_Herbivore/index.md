### Third-party mutualists have contrasting effects on host invasion under the enemy-release and biotic-resistance hypotheses

Chandra N. Jack • Maren L. Friesen • Arend Hintze • Leigh Sheneman

Plants engage in complex multipartite interactions with mutualists and antagonists,
but these interactions are rarely included in studies that explore plant invasiveness.
When considered in isolation, we know that beneficial microbes can enhance an exotic
plant’s invasive ability and that herbivorous insects often decrease an exotic plant’s
likeliness of success. However, the effect of these partners on plant fitness has not been
well characterized when all three species coevolve. We use computational evolutionary
modeling of a trait-based system to test how microbes and herbivores simultaneously
coevolving with an invading plant affect the invaders’ probability of becoming established.
Specifically, we designed a model that explores how a beneficial microbe would influence
the outcome of an interaction between a plant and herbivore. To model novel interactions,
we included a phenotypic trait shared by each species. Making this trait continuous and
selectable allows us to explore how trait similarities between coevolving plants, herbivores
and microbes affect fitness. Using this model, we answer the following questions: 
(1) Can a beneficial plant-microbe interaction influence the evolutionary outcome of antagonistic
interactions between plants and herbivores? 

(2) How does the initial trait similarity between interacting organisms affect the likelihood of plant survival in novel locations? 
(3) Does the effect of tripartite interactions on the invasion success of a plant depend on
whether organisms interact through trait similarity [Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)] or
dissimilarity (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis)?
