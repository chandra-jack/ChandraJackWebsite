My essay with co-authors Renee H. Petipas, Tanya E. Cheeke, Jennifer L. Rowland and Maren L. Friesen was accepted as an Opinion in Trends in Microbiology.  We outline potential negative consequences of microbial invasions and describe a set of practices (Testing, Regulation, Engineering, and Eradication, TREE) based on the four stages of invasion to prevent microbial inoculants from becoming invasive.
