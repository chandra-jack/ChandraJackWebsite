Exciting News! 

My grant entitled "Linking functional and taxonomic diversity of diazotrophs under contrasting management regimes for enhanced crop productivity" was deemed outstanding by the funding program and was awarded the highest possible amount $500,000. This is my first funded external grant, and first as lead PI.
