I am an evolutionary biologist interested in studying the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biotic interactions (microbe-microbe, plant-microbe, plant-insect, and all combinations).
The ubiquitous nature of microbes and their association with all living organisms makes them an ideal system for studying how coevolution between species has led to long-term cooperative associations and how intra-and interspecific microbial conflict can determine the population structure of the plant microbiome. My current and future research seek to understand how microbes influence plant fitness, functional traits, and population structure; how genetic variation is maintained through species interactions; and the consequences of these interactions under different environmental conditions. 



I am currently a Research Associate in the [Friesen Lab](http://css.wsu.edu/people/faculty/maren-l-friesen/) studying the influence of diazotrophs on plant fitness and traits.
